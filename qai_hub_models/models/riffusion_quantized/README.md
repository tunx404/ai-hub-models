# [Riffusion: State-of-the-art generative AI model used to generate spectrogram images given any text input. These spectrograms can be converted into audio clips](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/riffusion_quantized)

Generates high resolution spectrograms images from text prompts using a latent diffusion model. This model uses CLIP ViT-L/14 as text encoder, U-Net based latent denoising, and VAE based decoder to generate the final image.

This is based on the implementation of Riffusion found
[here](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/tree/main). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm速 devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/riffusion_quantized).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) for early access to run these models on
a hosted Qualcomm速 device.




## Example & Usage

Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install "qai_hub_models[riffusion_quantized]"
```


Once installed, run the following simple CLI demo:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.riffusion_quantized.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment

This repository contains export scripts that produce a model optimized for
on-device deployment. This can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.riffusion_quantized.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option. Note that the above
script requires access to Deployment instructions for Qualcomm速 AI Hub.
