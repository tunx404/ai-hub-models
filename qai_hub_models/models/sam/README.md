# [Segment-Anything-Model: High-quality segmentation mask generation around any object in an image with simple input prompt](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/sam)

Transformer based encoder-decoder where prompts specify what to segment in an image thereby allowing segmentation without the need for additional training. The image encoder generates embeddings and the lightweight decoder operates on the embeddings for point and mask based image segmentation.

This is based on the implementation of Segment-Anything-Model found
[here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm速 devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/sam).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) for early access to run these models on
a hosted Qualcomm速 device.




## Example & Usage

Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install "qai_hub_models[sam]"
```


Once installed, run the following simple CLI demo:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.sam.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment

This repository contains export scripts that produce a model optimized for
on-device deployment. This can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.sam.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option. Note that the above
script requires access to Deployment instructions for Qualcomm速 AI Hub.
