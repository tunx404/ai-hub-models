headline: Quantized real-time object detection optimized for mobile and edge.
domain: Computer Vision
description: YoloV7 is a machine learning model that predicts bounding boxes and classes
  of objects in an image. This model is post-training quantized to int8 using samples
  from the COCO dataset.
